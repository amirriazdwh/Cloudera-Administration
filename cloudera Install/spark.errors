Spark has a feature called "history server" which allows you to browse historical events after the SparkContext dies. 
This property is set via setting spark.eventLog.enabled to true.

You have two options, either specify a valid directory to store the event log via the spark.eventLog.dir config value, 
or simply set spark.eventLog.enabled to false if you don't need it.
