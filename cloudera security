cloudera hdfs cotains a group called supergroup.  the group is not defined in /etc/group file,  its been defined in hdfs configuration
the property is being set by dfs.permission.supergroup,  if its default value is supergroup which is not defined in /etc/groups.  the reaosn is, 
supergroup is if assigned to multiple user,  then this user also becomes a superuser. 

if you want multiple super users,  you must create a group name like superadmin and change the values of dfs.permission.supergroup to superadmin.  
then assign the users to that group. 

============================================================================================
in cloudera we can have sentry,  a sentry is similar to funsion middle in oracle.  it has an policy engine and policy provider store.  a policy provider store 
is a database. it store the privilage, roles, groups and user assigned to groups.  when a user is authenticated from ldap or from local /etc/passwd file, or
from kerbroses,  its been assigned a uidnumber,  this uid is matched goes to sentry,  which checks its authorization in policy store against the group and 
roles and assign it a sessionkey that user has been authenticated. 

when the same user query hive,  it goes to parser, then symatic analyser,  which check the tables, column access , if its authenticated,  query goves to planning
and then to optimization phase. 

sentry extends the acl of hdfs.  
The NameNode loads a Sentry plugin that caches Sentry privileges as well Hive metadata. This helps HDFS to keep file permissions and Hive tables privileges in sync. The Sentry plugin periodically polls Sentry to keep the metadata changes in sync.

For example, if Bob runs a Pig job that is reading from the Sales table data files, Pig will try to get the file handle from HDFS. At that point the Sentry plugin on the NameNode will figure out that the file is part of Hive data and overlay Sentry privileges on top of the file ACLs. As a result, HDFS will enforce the same privileges for this Pig client that Hive would apply for a SQL query.

For HDFS-Sentry synchronization to work, you must use the Sentry service, not policy file authorization. See Synchronizing HDFS ACLs and Sentry Permissions, for more details.

in cloudera 5.13 when sentry changes the privilage in table the privilage is also change on file level. through a plugin of hdfs. this keeps the 
authorization same for other tools. 

in case of cloudera the user authentication can be taken care by by user store in database, file system user. ldap or kerbroses
